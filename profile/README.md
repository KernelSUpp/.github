# An organization around forking KernelSU and related components (such as ZygiskNext).

## Why?
The developers and maintainers of said projects are not exactly reliable:
 - https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/issues/141#issuecomment-2329282354
 - https://xdaforums.com/t/warning-do-not-use-taichi-any-way.4012681/

As they like to [close-source](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/blob/copyright/README.md) all of their [projects](https://github.com/taichi-framework) and release them, potentially and possibly, (but not definitely), including malicious backdoors.
If you also review the source code of [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), you may notice it is particularly messy, and backwards with development, making it more incompatible with Android kernels with each update. 

**Do not spread hate to the said people.**
